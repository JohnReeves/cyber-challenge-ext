# Cyber Challenge

## Extension Worksheets

The de-cryping works by substituting characters for 
single letters and combinations of letters.

The de-crypt also uses:   
* an `affine cipher` to quick work out the other letters .  
*    

## Notes

The code shows how to use `c` to:   
* remove spaces;   
* reverse text;   
* shift an alphabet;   
* use the affine shift;   
* display the cipher & plain text; and   
* display the de-crypting alphabets.


## TODO

* letter frequencies;   
* double & triple letter frequencies;   
* test for words in a dictionary;   
* split sentences on likely words & phrases.
